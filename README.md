# Met Museum Wall of Art

This web-app collects data on art through the API of the The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. De images that are part of the data set are being used to build a responsive Wall of Art. Clicking on a piece of Art will bring you to the detail view. You can find a live version of the app at https://dennishemstra.com/wall_art/. You can also find it on my CodePen https://codepen.io/Dennisch/pen/MWxeLWP
